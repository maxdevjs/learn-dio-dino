Code for `Recriando o famoso jogo do dinossauro sem internet`

## Instructions

### How to play

`Press space to start and to jump.`

## Resources

A few resources that I test in this project.

### In game screenshot

Note: the following solution works with original, clean code. Not working with `stars`, gradient `background`, ...

To take screenshots when playing, the code must be served by a (local) server.

## TODO

- [ ] refactor code
- [ ] initial instructions screen (instead of playing straight and with no clues about how to play). Perhaps
- [ ] pause?
- [ ] double jump (regression?)
- [ ] create stars, background, etc from scratch (no plain copy & paste ðŸ˜„)
- [ ] sound?
- [ ] game over effect
